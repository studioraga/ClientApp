# Client App

ClientApp is a mobile app which can be used to tweak, control IoT device back end application ( BlinkLed) remotely.

This app talks to firebase, which in turns passes the config parameter to IoT device running backend application (which listens to Firebase). 

It is important to configure the authentication and database of firebase console before using the ClientApp.
